This is my Xander Project on creating a table in SQL and then exporting the file to Github. I first found the dataset on Kaggle called Spotify Artist Data, which provided me with data on various musicians and their streaming statistics. I then created a ER diagram in SQL which allowed me to identify the Primary Key and to clean the data. During the cleaning process, I identifed two columns, 'Last Updated' and 'Streaming in Billions' which could be removed. This was because I already had a column that had a similar name related to streaming numbers per artist in millions, and the last updated column was largely redundant. I then created my representation of the dataset by creating a table using SQL on Pycharm. I then established a connection to the database instance and added rows to the table. Once the table was created, I then shared my project on Github.
